# Copilot Instructions for WEBDEV Workspace

## Overview
This workspace is a collection of HTML and JavaScript files for web development learning and experimentation. There is no build system, package manager, or external dependencies. All files are static and can be opened directly in a browser.

## Directory Structure
- `HTML/`: Contains HTML files and related CSS/images. Each HTML file demonstrates a specific concept (e.g., responsive design, typography).
- `Javascript/`: Contains JavaScript files for basic scripting and experimentation.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **No Frameworks:** All code is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No React, Vue, or build tools.
- **File Naming:** Files are named after the concept they demonstrate (e.g., `responsive.html`, `typography.html`).
- **CSS Organization:** CSS files are separated by topic (e.g., `responsive.css`, `typography.css`).
- **Image Assets:** Images (e.g., `starc.webp`) are stored alongside HTML/CSS files for easy reference.
- **Direct Linking:** HTML files link to their corresponding CSS and JS files using relative paths.

## Developer Workflow
- **Preview:** Open any HTML file directly in a browser to view changes. No build or serve step is required.
- **Edit:** Modify HTML, CSS, or JS files as needed. Changes are reflected immediately upon browser refresh.
- **No Tests:** There are no automated tests or test frameworks in this workspace.

## Examples
- To experiment with responsive design, edit `HTML/responsive.html` and `HTML/responsive.css`.
- To add JavaScript, create or modify files in `Javascript/` and link them in the relevant HTML files.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- When adding new examples, follow the existing naming and organization conventions.
- Do not introduce frameworks, build tools, or package managers unless explicitly requested.
- Keep all assets (images, CSS) close to the HTML files they support.
- Use relative paths for all links and references.

## Reference Files
- `HTML/index.html`: Likely the main entry point or landing page.
- `HTML/responsive.html`, `HTML/typography.html`: Example-driven HTML files.
- `Javascript/first.js`: Example JavaScript file.
